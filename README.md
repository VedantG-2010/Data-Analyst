# Data-Analyst

In this Uber New York data analysis project, I utilized Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, and Plotly for tasks ranging from data reading to spatial analysis. I conducted thorough data preprocessing and cleaning, identified peak and off-peak months, analyzed hourly rush periods, determined the most active Uber base number, and performed spatial and pairwise analyses to unveil pickup patterns. Explore the comprehensive findings and insights on Uber pickups in New York City.
